# 🪞 Learning & Reflection Report

## 🤖 AI Development Skills Applied

### 🧠 Prompt Engineering
- I learned to break large feature requests into smaller, promptable workflows.
- Prompting Cursor with context (existing features, tech stack, design choices) produced more accurate and usable output.
- The most effective prompts were ones that asked for both **code and explanation** — helping me learn while building.

### 🔗 Tool Orchestration
- My primary AI tool was **Cursor IDE**, which integrated AI seamlessly into my dev workflow.
- I used it alongside manual testing tools like Postman and browser devtools.
- Cursor acted like an assistant, while I focused on stitching everything together.

### ✅ Quality Validation
- Since automated tests were limited, I validated AI-generated code by:
  - Reviewing line-by-line logic
  - Running Postman requests and debugging with backend logs
  - Manually testing the full frontend flows to catch edge cases

## 💼 Business Value Delivered

### 🧩 Functional Requirements
- ~90% of the core requirements were delivered within 2 days.
- Trade-offs included skipping real-time infra and test automation to prioritize deployable, visible functionality.

### 🎨 User Experience
- AI helped me build reusable, clean React components.
- Real-time-feel features like polling notifications added interactivity without overcomplicating the stack.

### 🧰 Code Quality
- Cursor followed best practices (DTOs, REST patterns, service separation).
- I used Flyway to version DB changes, JWT for secure auth, and role-based access for maintainability and scalability.

## 📘 Key Learnings

### 🏆 Most Valuable AI Technique
- Breaking features into **clear, contextual prompts** with examples of input/output structures.
- Cursor’s ability to convert verbal workflows into backend entities, services, and React forms was extremely useful.

### 🚧 Biggest Challenge
- AI struggled with test scaffolding, JWT validation testing, and context-carryover between prompts (especially if not re-supplied).

### 🔁 Process Improvements
- I would spend more time structuring prompt libraries early in the project.
- Starting with test setup on day one would have made validation smoother.

### 🧠 Knowledge Gained
- I learned practical techniques for building full-stack systems quickly using AI.
- I also got deeper understanding of how to structure real-world features like:
  - Role-based access control
  - Poll-based notification workflows
  - Time tracking in teams

## 🚀 Future Application

### 👥 Team Integration
- I would teach teammates to use AI tools like Cursor to speed up boilerplate and architecture scaffolding.
- Even junior devs can contribute faster with proper prompt training.

### 🛠️ Process Enhancement
- Future teams could maintain a **shared prompt library** for common tasks.
- Integrating AI review into PRs (Pull Requests) could assist with refactoring and documentation.

### 🏢 Scaling Considerations
- With the right conventions, AI-assisted development can scale across enterprise-level modules.
- Teams could split features, auto-generate scaffolding, and still maintain consistency using shared AI guidance and base prompts.
